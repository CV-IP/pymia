Main Features
=============
pymia's main features are data handling, a deep learning interface, and metrics for result evaluation.
We recommend to follow our example series "How to use the pymia for deep learning projects" under :doc:`examples`.
Further, pymia provides basic image filtering and plotting functionality.
