Open source code
================
Parts of pymia base on some open source code, which we acknowledge hereby:

 - Some distance metrics in the :mod:`pymia.evaluation.metric` package are taken from https://github.com/deepmind/surface-distance.
 - The :mod:`pymia.evaluation.metric` package is largely inspired by https://github.com/Visceral-Project/EvaluateSegmentation.
